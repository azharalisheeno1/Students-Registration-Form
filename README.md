I have meticulously crafted a student registration form using React.js, leveraging the power of React Routes for seamless navigation between different sections of the application. To manage form validation with elegance and efficiency, I integrated Formik and Yup libraries, ensuring data integrity and user-friendly error handling.

For a sleek and responsive design, I embraced Tailwind CSS, utilizing its utility-first approach to effortlessly create a visually appealing layout that adapts flawlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
